## About

Hello! My name is Charlie Hoose and I am a fourth year Statistics and Data Science major with a Data Science Engineering minor at UCLA. I am from the Santa Ynez Valley in California (think Solvang, right above Santa Barbara) and have grown up there all my life. 

At UCLA, you can find me checking out exciting restaurants, trying to recreate those meals in my own kitchen, or rifling through crates at record stores.

Professionally, I have experience with Data Science, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in data modeling and trying to make predictions from initially-messy or convoluted data sources.
